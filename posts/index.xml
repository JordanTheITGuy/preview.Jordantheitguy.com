            </div>On December 10th 2021 CVE-2021-44228 was unveiled- queue the mass panic. A simple logging component which had been around for… forever in a whole bunch of things including but not limited to Minecraft.
Update: February 6th 2022 - It&rsquo;s worth nothing that even now three months later this vulnerability is still having massive impact all over the world as the threat hunting methods originally devised were limited in their nature. In fact, we have even seen cases where grey hat hackers were using the exploit to patch the exploit.]]></description></item><item><title>Automatic Deployment Rule Update ID Translation</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/automatic-deployment-rule-update-id-translation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jordan Benzing</dc:creator><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/automatic-deployment-rule-update-id-translation/</guid><description>If you’ve ever worked with Automatic Deployment Rules, at some point an update has failed to download. While you might be familiar with the RuleEngine.log file, did know the “updateID” is the “CI_ID”? If you’ve ever tried to find a software update via CI_ID, you know you’re going to one of two places, and neither of them is the console. Essentially, if you’re here you’re looking for an easy way to figure out what update caused this error:</description></item><item><title>Query Defender for Endpoint Part 2</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/query-defender-for-endpoint-part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jordan Benzing</dc:creator><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/query-defender-for-endpoint-part-2/</guid><description>Part Two on Getting Data from Defender for Endpoint This blog is the second post in a multipart series on how to get data from Defender for endpoint and analyze the patching data that is returned. Previously, we covered how to build a token, and request data from the Defender for endpoint API. This time we will cover how to create an azure app registration that allows the minimum required permissions to gather this data.</description></item><item><title>Query Defender for Endpoint Part 1</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/query-defender-for-endpoint-part-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jordan Benzing</dc:creator><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/query-defender-for-endpoint-part-1/</guid><description>Vulnerability Management is HARD nderstanding patch compliance is mission critical task for all organizations regardless of their size or affiliation. What a lot of organizations struggle with is the different between vulnerabilities and patch compliance. As a result a lot of companies end up buying expensive third party tools to scan their environment for vulnerabilities, which happens to include your base Microsoft Patches.
These vulnerability scans result in providing a huge sometimes seemingly unconquerable list for the IT department.</description></item><item><title>To Do With Siri</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/to-do-with-siri/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jordan Benzing</dc:creator><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/to-do-with-siri/</guid><description>It’s just after the first of the year, and I’m sure those New Years resolutions are still burning in the background of everyone’s heads. What better way to accomplish those resolutions than using the tools we have available to us!
Well, I tried to use Microsoft ToDo last year. I really did. I found whenever I was sitting in front of a computer I was very dilligent in it’s usage and accomplishing things.</description></item><item><title>Mr Shiba What Time Is It - Get Time Remotely</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/mr-shiba-what-time-is-it-get-time-remotely/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jordan Benzing</dc:creator><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/mr-shiba-what-time-is-it-get-time-remotely/</guid><description>If you’ve ever worked in a large distributed environment you’ve likely experienced time issues. Maybe it’s not even so much an issue as you just want to know where the heck in the world a machine is. Especially in the current state of the world where almost every other day I wake up and go “WHAT YEAR IS IT” every day is Monday and everything is always on fire
I’m sure you’re thinking can’t I just invoke command to it?</description></item><item><title>Adding E-Mail Property in AD</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/adding-email-property-in-ad/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jordan Benzing</dc:creator><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/adding-email-property-in-ad/</guid><description>A few months back I worked on a project to configure a password manager that was managing accounts across multiple domains without a trust.
The Problem: This password management software was actually pretty cool. It’s able to match user accounts in its secure data base using a particular active directory attribute. In this case the e-mail field. Unfortunately, the users with accounts in both domains didn’t have the same e-mail attribute.</description></item><item><title>Protected Groups in Active Directory</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/protected-groups-in-active-directory/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jordan Benzing</dc:creator><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/protected-groups-in-active-directory/</guid><description>The Question:
This morning we hired a new and wonderful guy for our Help-desk and when setting up this persons account a strange oddity occured that caused one of the other helpdesk workers to come over to me and ask, “Hey why can’t I reset this new guys account? I can reset anyone else’s account but not his”. Now, I’m not proud I’ll admit at first I was stumped on this one there shouldn’t be any reason why you can’t reset his account I said – Mildly grumpy having only had one cup of coffee so far that day – Show me what you mean!</description></item><item><title>PowerShell Get Members Of Group</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/powershell_get_members_of_group/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jordan Benzing</dc:creator><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/powershell_get_members_of_group/</guid><description>Every now and again there comes a need to get the members of a group and manipulate that data in some fashion.
Now there are many ways to skin this cat and work with this data from VBscript, to utilizing DSquery to Quest Powershell CMDLETS to just raw powershell cmdlets.
Rather than spend time writing a new script every time you work at a different place or having to change constants in a script I spent some time writing a quick powershell script that accepts some variable information an outputs a CSV, or TXT file (your choice) with the user’s SAMaccountName combined with first and last name for all members of that group.</description></item><item><title>Powershell Change The Local Administrator Account/Password</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/powershell_change_localadminpassword/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jordan Benzing</dc:creator><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/posts/powershell_change_localadminpassword/</guid><description>What Happened? Back in May of 2014 Microsoft released a windows update – MS14-025 – that removed the ability to push out passwords to workstations remotely using group policy due to issues with elevation of privilege. If that patch is applied it’s a rather large pain to change the local admin after that without something like SCCM in place.
Working Around the Issue After working through some similar issues and reading a few TechNet Articles I decided to build a quick and slightly dirty powershell script to do several things as needed.</description></item></channel></rss>
