A simple logging component which had been around for… forever in a whole bunch of things including but not limited to Minecraft.
Update: February 6th 2022 - It&amp;rsquo;s worth nothing that even now three months later this vulnerability is still having massive impact all over the world as the threat hunting methods originally devised were limited in their nature. In fact, we have even seen cases where grey hat hackers were using the exploit to patch the exploit.</description></item><item><title>Automatic Deployment Rule Update ID Translation</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/automatic-deployment-rule-update-id-translation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/automatic-deployment-rule-update-id-translation/</guid><description>If you’ve ever worked with Automatic Deployment Rules, at some point an update has failed to download. While you might be familiar with the RuleEngine.log file, did know the “updateID” is the “CI_ID”? If you’ve ever tried to find a software update via CI_ID, you know you’re going to one of two places, and neither of them is the console. Essentially, if you’re here you’re looking for an easy way to figure out what update caused this error:</description></item><item><title>Query Defender for Endpoint Part 2</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/query-defender-for-endpoint-part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/query-defender-for-endpoint-part-2/</guid><description>Part Two on Getting Data from Defender for Endpoint This blog is the second post in a multipart series on how to get data from Defender for endpoint and analyze the patching data that is returned.

What a lot of organizations struggle with is the different between vulnerabilities and patch compliance. As a result a lot of companies end up buying expensive third party tools to scan their environment for vulnerabilities, which happens to include your base Microsoft Patches.
These vulnerability scans result in providing a huge sometimes seemingly unconquerable list for the IT department.</description></item><item><title>To Do With Siri</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/to-do-with-siri/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/to-do-with-siri/</guid><description>It’s just after the first of the year, and I’m sure those New Years resolutions are still burning in the background of everyone’s heads. What better way to accomplish those resolutions than using the tools we have available to us!
Well, I tried to use Microsoft ToDo last year. I really did. I found whenever I was sitting in front of a computer I was very dilligent in it’s usage and accomplishing things.</description></item><item><title>Mr Shiba What Time Is It - Get Time Remotely</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/mr-shiba-what-time-is-it-get-time-remotely/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/mr-shiba-what-time-is-it-get-time-remotely/</guid><description>If you’ve ever worked in a large distributed environment you’ve likely experienced time issues. Maybe it’s not even so much an issue as you just want to know where the heck in the world a machine is. Especially in the current state of the world where almost every other day I wake up and go “WHAT YEAR IS IT” every day is Monday and everything is always on fire
I’m sure you’re thinking can’t I just invoke command to it?</description></item><item><title>Adding E-Mail Property in AD</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/adding-email-property-in-ad/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/adding-email-property-in-ad/</guid><description>A few months back I worked on a project to configure a password manager that was managing accounts across multiple domains without a trust.
The Problem: This password management software was actually pretty cool. It’s able to match user accounts in its secure data base using a particular active directory attribute. In this case the e-mail field. Unfortunately, the users with accounts in both domains didn’t have the same e-mail attribute.</description></item><item><title>Protected Groups in Active Directory</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/protected-groups-in-active-directory/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/protected-groups-in-active-directory/</guid><description>The Question:
This morning we hired a new and wonderful guy for our Help-desk and when setting up this persons account a strange oddity occured that caused one of the other helpdesk workers to come over to me and ask, “Hey why can’t I reset this new guys account? I can reset anyone else’s account but not his”. Now, I’m not proud I’ll admit at first I was stumped on this one there shouldn’t be any reason why you can’t reset his account I said – Mildly grumpy having only had one cup of coffee so far that day – Show me what you mean!</description></item><item><title>PowerShell Get Members Of Group</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/powershell_get_members_of_group/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/powershell_get_members_of_group/</guid><description>Every now and again there comes a need to get the members of a group and manipulate that data in some fashion.
Now there are many ways to skin this cat and work with this data from VBscript, to utilizing DSquery to Quest Powershell CMDLETS to just raw powershell cmdlets.
Rather than spend time writing a new script every time you work at a different place or having to change constants in a script I spent some time writing a quick powershell script that accepts some variable information an outputs a CSV, or TXT file (your choice) with the user’s SAMaccountName combined with first and last name for all members of that group.</description></item><item><title>Powershell Change The Local Administrator Account/Password</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/powershell_change_localadminpassword/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/powershell_change_localadminpassword/</guid><description>What Happened? Back in May of 2014 Microsoft released a windows update – MS14-025 – that removed the ability to push out passwords to workstations remotely using group policy due to issues with elevation of privilege. If that patch is applied it’s a rather large pain to change the local admin after that without something like SCCM in place.
Working Around the Issue After working through some similar issues and reading a few TechNet Articles I decided to build a quick and slightly dirty powershell script to do several things as needed.</description></item><item><title>Visio 2010/2013 Client Server Version Error in SCOM 2012R2 Visio Drawings</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/client_server_version_error_in_scom_2012r2_visio/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/client_server_version_error_in_scom_2012r2_visio/</guid><description>The Question:
Testing Level 2 Testing Level 3 “Wouldn’t it be awesome if we could create pretty Visio Drawings of our systems for the customers to look at and see up-time of servers using SCOM Data?”
Well turns out in fact you can do this! It’s a feature it’s been around in SCOM for quite some time. However it’s not exactly the best documented component and certainly has a couple of pit fulls, among them the frustrating “Client Not Supported Error”.</description></item><item><title>How To Reset Permissions on a Users Home Directory</title><link>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/how_to_reset_permissions_on_a_users_home_directory/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://preview.jordantheitguy.com/post/how_to_reset_permissions_on_a_users_home_directory/</guid><description>Below is a script, provided as is, that is a non-fancy way to reset permissions with some sense of logic on a users home directory.

Nice to meet you. If you&amp;rsquo;ve found your way here to my about page, you&amp;rsquo;re probably looking for some information about who I am and what I do, so let me help fill in some blanks.
I&amp;rsquo;m an engineer. I do engineering things. I started working in IT back in 2008, my first year of college. Somehow my resident assistant saw me playing World Of Warcraft and said: &amp;ldquo;hey, want a job,&amp;rdquo; to which I said, well, I like money, and the next thing I knew, I was building a print server.</description></item></channel></rss>
